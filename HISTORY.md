### June 2010 (11.02)
The DirectX SDK (June 2010) included an update with some minor additional bug fixes. This also included the Effects 11-based sample DynamicShaderLinkageFX11. This is the last version to support Visual Studio 2008.  The source code is located in ``Samples\C++\Effects11``.

### February 2010 (11.01)
An update was shipped with the DirectX SDK (February 2010). This fixed a problem with the library which prevented it from working correctly on 9.x and 10.x feature levels. This is the last version to support Visual Studio 2005. The source code is located in ``Samples\C++\Effects11``.

### August 2009 (11.00)
The initial release of Effects 11 (FX11) was in the DirectX SDK (August 2009). The source code is located in ``Utilities\Source\Effects11``. This is essentially the Effects 10 (FX10) system ported to Direct3D 11.0 with support for effects pools removed and support for groups added.
